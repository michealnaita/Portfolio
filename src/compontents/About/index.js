              I am a Front-end Web engineer based in Uganda with experience
              building websites and web applications. I specialize in JavaScript
              and have professional experience working with React.js and
              Node.js. I also have experience working with Firebase, Mysql, HTML
              and CSS

                  Over the past months, I have worked on various projects
                  through freelance work and personal projects with that
                  experience, I believe that I can hack my way around
                  complicated user interfaces and tasks that require
                  problem-solving to build beautiful user interfaces
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Iâ€™m excited about learning how to better my skills and new
                  conventions used in the industry for overall self-improvement,
                  That is why for every project that I work on I look at it as
                  an opportunity to learn or implement something new.
